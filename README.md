# Image Copy and Rename Script

This Python script copies image files from a source directory to a destination directory, renaming them sequentially as image1, image2, image3, and so on.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Usage

1. Update the `source_dir` variable in the script with the path to your "Photos Library.photoslibrary" folder.
2. Update the `dest_dir` variable in the script with the path to your "Untitled" external drive, followed by the "OrganizedPhotos" folder.
3. Save the script as `copy_rename_images.py`.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
5. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python copy_rename_images.py
```
This script will copy and rename the image files (based on the specified file extensions) from the "Photos Library.photoslibrary" folder to the "OrganizedPhotos" folder on the "Untitled" external drive. The images will be renamed sequentially as image1, image2, image3, and so on.
